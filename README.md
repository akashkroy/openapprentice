# openapprentice

Open Apprentice is currently a personal project with the intention to Open Source the training materials, and entire website.

The purpose of Open Apprentice is to provide a venue for hiring personnel to discover talent and for talent to become skilled in the technologies needed by companies around the world.

This Github will be updated as I progress and learn myself.

As of this moment, there is nothing uploaded to the websites.

TODO:

Get the websites: openapprentice.org up with some sort of introduction
Route openapprentice.com to forward to openapprentice.org.
